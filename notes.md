FIXES NEEDED
- value of ace to 1 or 11 (currently only 11)
- draw from same deck everytime until reshuffle needed (currently creates new deck)


FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
- connect to database (mongodb?)
- user authentication (store player chip counts? daily chip reward using date object?)
- chip count/betting option
- doubling down, splitting, insurance?
- animations for dealing/drawing cards maybe?
